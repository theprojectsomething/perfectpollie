    <section class="what-what-what">
      <h2 id="what-what-what">I don't get it. Please explain. ü§î</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>It's just a face mashup of Australian politicians (pollies)</strong>, backed up by a sprinkle of <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/data">real data</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Every face is unique!</strong> There are currently <strong class="combos">2,495,102,400</strong> possible combinations (that's billions). So, in all likelihood, you're the only person that will ever lay eyes on ‚Äú<span class="pollie">your pollie</span>‚Äù &hellip; unless they're worth a share!</li>
        <li><strong>It's fun üéâ because the frankenstein faces look ridiculous</strong>, and because you get a little bit of insight into what the pollies and parties are about. It's also less shouty than question time (or any political communication for that matter). Officially, the intention here is to educate the public, raise awareness and encourage debate ü•∏.</li>
        <li>How do the numbers work? <strong>On this site we're only interested in <em>consistent</em> voting</strong>, so at an individual level we're looking at the policies that have been voted on the same way, every time. Yes shortfalls / but also simplicity.</li>
        <li><strong>We compare the policies and the vote</strong> from each of our selected politicians (a yay or nay) and compile a list of policies that all (who voted) agree on:
          <ol>
            <li>"Big ticket" policies are those that all four voted on and agreed on. The same vote on every division, every time.</li>
            <li>"Strongly held" policies have at least three people voting and agreeing (the other person didn't vote at all).</li>
            <li>"Weakly held" policies have only one or two people agreeing and consistently voting. The missing people haven't voted on this policy so we don't know how they feel.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, <strong>for party comparisons we check for a simple majority on each policy</strong>. If our individual's vote goes the same way we summise that they are voting with the party (regardless of their actual party).</li>
        <li>You can find a lot more ins and outs of the vote-counting system (that's the one behind our system) on the <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/data">They Vote for You</a> website, which is our data source and provides all the sordid details of how votes are recorded and weighed (it's complicated!)</li>
        <li>Technology-wise it's all pretty lo-fi, but we can boast that we used <strong>AI (AI!) (ü§ñ!)</strong> to get the faces to match .. and some other stuff we won't boast about.

The code is <a href="https://github.com/theprojectsomething/perfectpollie" title="Careful, it's still a mess">open source</a>.</li>
        <li>Oh, and it's a work-in-progress and constantly improving. So yes, expect mistakes. Many, many mistakes.</li>
